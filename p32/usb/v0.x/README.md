Note :
===========
This code compiles but it (v0.x) doesn't work at that time :-(
It is published only with the hope that it will be useful for the
Pinguino community.

Usage :
===========

It is possible to automatically build the bootloader for a variety of
Microchip 32-bit processors. To build it for a particular processor run
for e.g. :

	make --makefile=Makefile PROC=32MX250F128B

Use DEBUG to disassemble the code. Results are in obj/*.S
for e.g. :

	make --makefile=Makefile PROC=32MX250F128B DEBUG=yes

If your processor is not yet supported, just add a linker file in the
lkr directory.

Contact :
===========

Please contact rblanchot@pinguino.cc if you add support to any processor,
make any improvment or fix any bug.
